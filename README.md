# LinkedList
A LinkedList is a node that has a specific value attached to it (sometimes called a payload), and a link to another node (or 'nil' if there is no next item).

### Linked List 1
Using a set of numbers, implement the reverse_list method to display the numbers using at the start in reverse.

### Linked List 2
I will now change the existing LinkedList as I go through the list by adjusting the 'next_node' to point to the previous node.
